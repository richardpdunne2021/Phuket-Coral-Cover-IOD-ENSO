# Phuket-Coral-Cover-IOD-ENSO
Analysis of coral cover on the reef flat at Phuket and the effects of IOD and ENSO on sea level and sea temperature.

This folder contains R code and data used for a submission to the journal 'Global Change Biology' for a paper titled:

     The Indian Ocean Dipole and El Niño Southern Oscillation as major drivers of coral cover on shallow reefs in the Andaman Sea
     Authors: R.P. Dunne, B.E. Brown, N. Phongsuwan, L. Putchim

All R code was written and run under R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) using R Studio.

Contents:
1. R code - 'Analysis of DMI from NOAA NetCDF data - Fig 1A.R'. This code requires data from the NetCDF file 'dmi to 13 Jan 2021.nc'. It is used to produce Fig 1A in the paper and to output monthly values of DMI to a CSV file for use in the later GAMM models.
2. Data File - 'dmi to 13 Jan 2021.nc'.3. 
4. R code - 'Plotting of Phototransect Results Figures 5 & 6.R'. This code is used to produce Figures 5 and 6 and requires data from the file 'Coral Cover Phototransects.xlsx'
5. Data File - 'Coral Cover Phototransects.xlsx'.
